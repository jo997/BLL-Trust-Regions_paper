# Case Study on Threshold Value in Bayesian Neural Network Last Layer

## Introduction
This repository contains the findings of a case study focusing on the determination of threshold values in the last layer of a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN). The study investigates the impact of threshold selection on model predictive control, referencing the paper "Model Predictive Control with Neural Network System Model and Bayesian Last Layer Trust Regions" by Felix Fiedler and Sergio Lucia.  

The case study explores the role of threshold values in enhancing the performance and reliability of Bayesian Neural Networks, particularly in the context of model predictive control systems.   
It investigates various threshold selections and evaluates their impact on system behavior and control performance.
